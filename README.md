# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm Hugo Coutinho, currently studying Computer Engineering at ISEP. I’m focused on leveling up my programming skills — learning Java, Unix commands, Git, and all the essentials to build real projects. I’m always trying to understand how things work behind the scenes and improve a bit every day.<br>Fun fact about me: I fix most bugs with coffee and stubbornness.
